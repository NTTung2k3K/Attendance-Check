# IoT Attendance Check System

## Overview

This project is an IoT-based attendance check system that uses an ESP8266 module to connect to Google Sheets for sending attendance data. The system includes a fingerprint scanner to identify students and an Arduino board to process the data. The project features a wired connection, and a detailed diagram and component list are provided.

## Features

- **Fingerprint Scanning:** Identifies students based on their fingerprints.
- **Real-Time Data Transmission:** Sends attendance data to Google Sheets using the ESP8266 module.
- **Arduino Processing:** Processes fingerprint data and manages communication between components.
- **Wired Connections:** Ensures reliable data transmission and component integration.
